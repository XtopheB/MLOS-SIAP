# Machine Learning For Official Statistics and SDGs

This repository contains the code (.Rmd) and data used for the course *Machine Learning For Official Statistics and SDGs* delivered online by the SIAP from 8 November to 24 December 2021. This repository follows the course's structure in different modules
Interactive tools built in Shiny are also embedded in specific directories and helped learners have a better intuition of the methods. 

> The code is created by Christophe Bontemps and Patrick Jonsson with help and inspiration from Pascal Lavergne.

## Module 0: You've seen this before

- Linear and non-linear regression
- Supervised vs unsupervised learning
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Statistical Learning vs Machine Learning
- Cross validation

*Including an interactive Shiny application that visualizes KNN-regression.*

## Module 2: Classification

- How classification works
- Supervised vs unsupervised classification
- Examples of classifiers
- Measures of fit
- Logit as a classifier
- How to choose the "best" model

*Including an interactive Shiny application visualizing a fitted logistic regression curve, the decision boundary, and accuracy measures.*

## Module 3: Regression-based methods

- Linear Regression and all his friends
- Selection of regressors
- Penalization Methods
- How to choose the best model?

## Module 4: Tree-Based Methods

- Decision Trees: Construction and visualization
- Selecting hyperparameters for trees
- From trees to forest
- Bagging & Feature sampling
- Random forest 

*Including an interactive Shiny application that visualizes how the complexity parameter affects the complexity of a decision tree.*

## Module 5: Advanced Methods

- Support Vector Machines
- K-means clustering
