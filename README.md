# Machine Learning For Official Statistics and SDGs

This repository contains the code (.Rmd) and data used for the course *Machine Learning For Official Statistics and SDGs* delivered online by the SIAP in 2021 and 2022. This course was designed as a 6 weeks course, but was extented to a 8 weeks course in 2022. This repository follows the course's structure in different modules
Interactive tools built in Shiny are also embedded in specific directories and helped learners have a better intuition of the methods. 

> The code is created by Christophe Bontemps and Patrick Jonsson (2021) and are based on the work and inspiration from Pascal Lavergne (Toulouse School of Economics).

## Module 0: You've seen this before

- Linear and non-linear regression
- Supervised vs unsupervised learning
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Statistical Learning vs Machine Learning
- Cross validation

*Including an interactive Shiny application that visualizes KNN-regression.*

## M1: Machine Learning for Official Statistics and the SDGs

- Introduction to the course
- Using Machine Leaning for Official Statistics

 - Limitations of Machine Learning predictions


## Module 2: Classification

- How classification works
- Supervised vs unsupervised classification
- Examples of classifiers
- Measures of fit
- Logit as a classifier
- How to choose the "best" model

*Including an interactive Shiny application visualizing a fitted logistic regression curve, the decision boundary, and accuracy measures.*

## Module 3: Regression-based methods

- Linear Regression and all his friends
- Selection of regressors
- Penalization Methods
- How to choose the best model?

## Module 4: Tree-Based Methods

- Decision Trees: Construction and visualization
- Visualizing a decision tree
- Bagging and Boosting
- From trees to forest
- Random Forest and Imputation

*Including an interactive Shiny application that visualizes how the complexity parameter affects the complexity of a decision tree.*
